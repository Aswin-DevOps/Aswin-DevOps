## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **DevOps Engineer with 2.5+ years of experience** in building, automating, and optimizing cloud infrastructure across **AWS & GCP**.  
I specialize in:

- **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**
- **CI/CD Automation** (Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD)
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform)
- **Containerization & Orchestration** (Docker, Kubernetes, Swarm, ECS/EKS)
- **Monitoring & Observability** (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, New Relic)
- **Serverless Architectures** (AWS Lambda, Cloud Run)

I love designing reliable, automated, and secure DevOps ecosystems that make deployments faster, systems more resilient, and teams more productive.
